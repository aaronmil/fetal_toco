The objective of this analysis is to indicate the conditions under which fetal health is determined to be suspect or pathological. The data is derived from fetal cardiotocographic monitors which measure the vitals of a fetus in utero. The Logistic Regression model with ADASYN oversampling, achieved the lowest proportion of false negatives. The two most impactful features were “Fetal Baseline Heart Rate” and “Frequency of Accelerations.”
